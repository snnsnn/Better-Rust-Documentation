Current Rust API website is a bit hard to follow. These Stylish themes aim to make language API documentation on https://doc.rust-lang.org and https://docs.rs more readable with color coding and hierarchical indentation.

* Sidebar links and titles reflects code coloring which enhanced hierarchy
* Code documentation reflects trait hierarchy
* Fixes width for large screens
* Puts background color and subtle border color around listed methods
* Removes boldness from [+] buttons and makes them smaller and dimmer
* Changes color highlighting of documentation and code blocks
