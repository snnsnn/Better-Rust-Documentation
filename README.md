# Better Rust API Documentation with Stylish Themes

Current Rust API website is a bit hard to follow. These Stylish themes aim to make language API documentation on https://doc.rust-lang.org and https://docs.rs more readable with color coding and hierarchical indentation.

* Sidebar links and titles reflects code coloring which enhanced hierarchy
* Code documentation reflects trait hierarchy
* Fixes width for large screens
* Puts background color and subtle border color around listed methods
* Removes boldness from [+] buttons and makes them smaller and dimmer
* Changes color highlighting of documentation and code blocks
* And much more..

## How to use

First install Stylus or Stylish add ons on your browser. Stylus is the better one. Then go to link and click install button. Make sure to use either dark or light theme since they overwrite each other.
